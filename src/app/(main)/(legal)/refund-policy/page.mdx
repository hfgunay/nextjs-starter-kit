# Refund Policy

At ToolDashAI, we are committed to providing a unique and innovative experience through our AI-generated content. We understand that while artificial intelligence is powerful and revolutionary, it may not always produce the results you expect. We want you to be fully aware of this inherent limitation before making any purchases.

### No Refunds on Used Credits

Due to the high operational costs associated with running advanced GPU infrastructure to deliver our AI services, **we do not offer refunds once credits have been used**. This policy ensures we can continue offering fair, consistent, and high-quality services to all users.

If you have purchased credits but have **not yet used any**, you may request a refund by contacting us at **support@tooldashai.com** within **14 days** of purchase, subject to review and approval. We reserve the right to decline refund requests that do not meet this condition.

### Exceptions

We may issue a refund **only** under the following circumstances:

- You were charged in error (e.g., double billing).
- You encountered a critical technical failure that prevented credit use **despite support assistance**.
- You made the purchase but never accessed or used any features.

Refunds, if approved, will be processed back to your original payment method.

### Our Promise

Your understanding and support mean a lot to us. As we continue to improve and enhance our site ToolDashAI, we hope you will join us in this journey of digital creativity and AI innovation.

If you have any questions regarding your purchase or refund eligibility, please reach out to **support@tooldashai.com**.
